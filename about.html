            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>Grupo Frontera is topping music charts in Mexico and the U.S., 
            has taken their music across borders and, with 15 nominations under its belt, 
            could be one of the most celebrated groups on Thursday night during the 2023 
            Billboard Latin Music Awards.At a time when regional Mexican music is reaching 
            global audiences, Grupo Frontera joins the list of artists of the likes of 
            Peso Pluma, Yahritza y Su Esencia and Fuerza Regida, who in addition to making Mexican
            fans in the U.S. fall in love with them, are also drawing admirers from people who do 
            not speak or understand Spanish. Born out of the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, 
            right at the southern border with Mexico, this group catapulted to fame thanks 
            to a cover song they uploaded to YouTube in 2022.</p>
